Reproducible and Open Biodiversity Data Science, with a focus on DNA
--------------------------------------------------------------------
_Biodiversity analysis_ can be broadly defined as the study and interpretation of patterns of species diversity and  
ecological functioning as structured by history and geography. In this field, data of a variety of different
types and dimensions need to be integrated and analyzed statistically to be able to meaningfully address relevant 
research questions. This course reviews these different types of data and the current methodologies for processing and
analyzing them. The review starts with one-dimensional, sequential data from which at least some relevant insights can
be gained by analyzing its diversity per se: DNA. While we are introducing ourselves to this in plenary form in the 
mornings, we will take two afternoons individually to work our way through an e-book about open science, open data and
open source practices. We will then do a hands-on practical in metabarcoding data analysis and conclude the week with 
a journal club where we discuss a relevant publication with each other in brief stand-up presentations.
