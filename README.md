### Introduction

This repository contains materials for the MSc course _Methods in Biodiversity Analysis_, offered through a 
collaboration between [Naturalis](http://naturalis.nl), [IBL](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/biology),
and [CML](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/wiskunde-en-natuurwetenschappen/milieuwetenschappen). The course is taught 
in the Sylvius Building (1.5.03) with some practicals in the Van Steenis Building, both on the main (bio)science campus 
of Leiden.

The goal of the course is to impart data science skills as relevant to biodiversity research. Technical topics to be 
covered will include research reproducibility (e.g. scripting) and data management (e.g. versioning), while the 
scientific applications will encompass biodiversity assessment using DNA sequence data (e.g. metabarcoding),
geospatial data (e.g. ecological niche modeling) and phenotype/morphology data (e.g. morphometrics). 

### Preparations

The course will consist of lectures and hands-on computer practicals that require you to have the following:

- a working laptop, any major operating system is fine
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (open source edition)
- [SQLite browser](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)
- [Java](https://java.com/)
- [an account on the Galaxy portal](http://galaxy.naturalis.nl/user/login?use_panels=True&redirect=%2F)
- [an account on EoL](https://eol.org/users/sign_up)
- an installation of Docker desktop ([windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), 
  [mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), or the 
  [windows toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) or
  [mac toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/))
